<h1>Welcome to ZFApp</h1>
<p>Congratulations, you have successfully set up the foundation for your application using <A href="http://www.zfapp.com/">ZFApp</A>, the premier application framework built on the industry-standard <A href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</A>. From here, you can begin building your PHP application!</p>
<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>
Now that you have layed the foundation, here's what you can do next:
<ul>
<li><b>Add templates to the include/views/ folder</b><br/>
You can start building your application immediately by breaking up your wireframes into templates and placing them in the views/ directory:<br/><br/>
<code>/views/index/index.tpl maps to http://yourapplication/</code><br/>
<code>/views/foo/bar.tpl maps to http://yourapplication/foo/bar/</code><br/><br/></li>
<li><b>Add logic to your application by creating controllers</b><br/>
Once you have your templates, you can start adding logic to them by creating ZFApp Controllers which accept input from the user, database, etc. and assign template variables for your templates.</li>
</ul>
