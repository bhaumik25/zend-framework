ZFApp Preview Release Installation/Usage instructions
---------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the ZFApp Preview Release. While functional as a framework, there are still some
things that need to get automated and cleaned up properly so installation is a little more
painful then it needs to be. This doc will guide you through that.

Here are the steps:

1) Extract the tarball (you probably just did that)

2) Copy the entire ZFApp directory to where you would like your new ZFApp application to
   be installed..

    $ cp -R ZFApp/ /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ZFBlog

3) Download and Smarty and copy the distribution into ZFBlog/lib/smarty

4) Download ZFramework, and copy the library itself (starting with the dir that has Zend.php)
   into ZFBlog/lib/Zlib. 

** Note: As an alternative you can simply symlink these dependencies

5) Execute the appgen.php script and give it the name of your application. 

    $ php appgen.php ZFBlog

   This script is really cheap at the moment, but basically what it does is
   configure a series of constants in the sources of the ZFApp to their real
   values.. i.e. replaces %APP_INC_DIR% with /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ZFBlog/include,
   etc.. This is one of those bits that needs a better implementation

6) Give write access to your web server for the %INSTALL_DIR%/webtmp directory and
   all of its subdirs:

   $ chgrp -R nobody /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ZFBlog/webtmp
   $ chmod -R 775 /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ZFBlog/webtmp

   (This is another part of the installation process that requires future automation)

7) Set up Apache by setting DocumentRoot to %INSTALL_DIR%/www/ and make sure the
   AllowOverride configuration directive is set to "All"


That's it! Once you've done that you can point your browser to the server and you'll see
a welcome screen for ZFApp if things went right. From here, you can start using the
framework.
