The following issues are not directly related to the Zend Framework,
but affect the design or implementation of the demo tutorial.

* 1. Content-type, Charset, DOCTYPE

The combination of HTTP headers, DOCTYPE, <html>, and <meta> tags
were carefully chosen to negotiate a complex situation:

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/
http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/xhtml-mimetype/content-negotiation
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:tips:xhtml_strict

Our goals:
+ user agents use only standards-mode rendering
  -i.e. avoid quirks-mode rendering by user agents!
+ UTF-8 support for the majority of browsers
+ avoid the use and need for the HTTP "Vary:" header

Conclusions:
+ Thus, we can not use an XML declaration before the DOCTYPE,
since IE would then render in quirks-mode.

+ A meta tag must be used to insure the character set and content-
type is not lost when a user saves a web page (e.g. to disk),
or sends a copy of the web page to a tool (e.g. XHTML validator).

+ Since we have little control over users' web servers,
the "Content-type" header must be used and set to
"text/html; charset=utf-8", even though the information
is duplicated in a meta tag, and is only helpful if
the web server is configured to send a different content-type.
